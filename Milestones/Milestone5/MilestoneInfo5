#Secure NodeJS Application

Add Logic to Handle User Login:
    When the user clicks the sign in button this should send a request to verify that username and password submitted belong to an already registered user.
    If the user credentials do not validate, the login view should be displayed showing an error message. (e.g. Either username or password are incorrect. Please try again.)
    If the user credentials are verified display the profile view.
Make use of the express-validator package to validate all input values read into the application
Update your application to escape dynamic output displayed in all views
