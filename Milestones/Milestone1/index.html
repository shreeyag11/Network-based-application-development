				<h2> About Us!</h2>
						<p class="content">Women's empowerment is the way or a social action in which women
						elaborate and recreate what it is to be in a circumstance that they
						previously were denied. Empowerment can be defined in many ways, 
						however, when talking about women's empowerment, empowerment means 
						accepting and allowing people (women) who are on the outside of the 
						decision-making process into it. â€œThis puts a strong emphasis on
						participation in political structures and formal decision-making and, 
						in the economic sphere, on the ability to obtain an income that enables
						participation in economic decision-making." Empowerment is the process
						that creates power in individuals over their own lives, society, and in
						their communities. People are empowered when they are able to access the 
						opportunities available to them without limitations and restrictions such
						as in education, profession and lifestyle. Feeling entitled to make your 
						own decisions creates a sense of empowerment. Empowerment includes the					action of raising the status of women through education, raising 
						awareness, literacy, and training. Women's empowerment is all about 
						equipping and allowing women to make life-determining decisions through
						the different problems in society.</p>
